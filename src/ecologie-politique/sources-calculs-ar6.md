# Sources et calculs - 6e Rapport du GIEC (2021-22)

[[toc]]

## Sans équivoque, l’influence humaine a réchauffé la planète, les océans et les terres. L’atmosphère, l’océan, la cryosphère et la biosphère ont été soumis à des changements rapides et de grande ampleur.

« It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred. » [[AR6 SPM A.1]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf#page=6&zoom=auto,-22,842)


## Les hausses observées de la concentration de gaz à effets de serre (GES) depuis 1750 environ sont causées par l’activité humaine, sans équivoque.

« Observed increases in well-mixed greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by human activities. » [[AR6 SPM A.1.1]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf#page=6&zoom=auto,-22,842)


## The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–201911 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. [[AR6 SPM A.1.3]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf#page=9&zoom=auto,-82,667)


## Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5.. [[AR6 SPM A.3]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf#page=12&zoom=auto,-82,412)


## Global surface temperature will continue to increase until at least mid-century under all emissions scenarios considered. Global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades. [AR6 SPM B.1]


## Many changes in the climate system become lar ger in direct relation to increasing global warming. They include increases in the frequency and intensity of hot extremes, marine heatwaves, heavy precipitation, and, in some regions, agricultural and ecological droughts; an increase in the proportion of intense tropical cyclones; and reductions in Arctic sea ice, snow cover and permafrost. [AR6 SPM B.2]


## Scenarios with very low or low GHG emissions (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) lead within years to discernible effects on greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations and air quality, relative to high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 or SSP5-8.5). Under these contrasting scenarios, discernible differences in trends of global surface temperature would begin to emerge from natural variability within around 20 years, and over longer time periods for many other climatic impact-drivers (high confidence)
